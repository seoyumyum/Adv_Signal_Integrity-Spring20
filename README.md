# Advanced Signal Integrity - Spring 2020
- HW1: Simulating pulse response in a transmission line at the near and far ends of the line.
- HW2: Charge distribution on a straight thin wire of length l and radius a using 'method of moments'
- HW3: Simulating the response of a losseless coupled-lines, and impedance matching on the coupled-line.
- HW4: Simulating the response of a lossy transmission line for the input of specific input pulse pattern.
